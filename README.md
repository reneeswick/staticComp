## Install + Setup
	- Clone down this repository.
	-From the root directory run ```open index.html```

## Wins
	- This was my first time using Grid. It was a wonderful challenge!

## Challenges + Improvements
	- This spec is not fully responsive to screen sizes as the header does not persist the way I would like. Future iterations will adjust this.
